# Image-Manipulation-Detection

To develop an image manipulation detection system, specifically focusing on two common types of forgeries: `copy-move` and `splicing`.

- **Copy-Move Forgery:** Copy-move forgery refers to the act of copying a specific portion of an image and pasting it onto another area within the same image.
- **Splicing Forgery:** Splicing forgery involves merging two or more images to create a single composite image. This technique aims to combine different elements or regions from multiple sources.
